    <h2>1. Order Cancellation Policy</h2>
    <h3>1.1 Cancellation Before Shipment</h3>

    <h3>2.1 Eligibility for Returns</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Condition of Products:</strong> To be eligible for a return, the product must be in its original condition, unused, and in the same packaging that you received it in. Products that are damaged, altered, or not in their original packaging may not be eligible for a return.</li>
        <li><strong>Return Window:</strong> You must initiate a return within 10 days of receiving the product. For B2B bulk orders, returns must be initiated within 7 days of receipt.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Returnable Items:</strong> Certain items are not eligible for return, including but not limited to:
